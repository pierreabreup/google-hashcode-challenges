# What is it

This project is a solution written in Ruby for Google Hash Code Pizza Subset Sum. This code is an idea about how to solve the challenger.

The challenge descript is avaible on `challenge.pdf`

Probably you will notice the code doesn't work very well with `e_also_big.in`. Feel free to solve it and open a Pull Request ;)
