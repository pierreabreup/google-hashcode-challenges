# What is it

This repo is a list of some Google Hash code challenges solutions I've made. All of the code available here is only an idea about how to solve the challenges.

Each folder present here is a Google Hash Code. In the folder, there is a solution and the challenge description (`challenge.pdf / challenge.png / challenge.jpg`)

Feel free to use my code but I encourage you to do not copy all code and use them as if were created by you. Try to read code, understand and improve it, do your best :D Moreover, if your code were better than mine, please open here a pull-request 8) 8)

If you have any questions, If you have any questions, mailing me ;)
